Examples for **Mono.Addins**

Really enjoy using [Mono.Addins](https://github.com/mono/mono-addins), however there is a lack of consistent examples. Their text editor sample does dive in pretty good, so check it out if you're beyond the beginner steps.

For official help documentation check out Mono.Addins Wiki page.

## Included Samples

* Ex1 - Simple Discovery (not included)
* Ex2 - Addin Discovery
* Ex3 - Addin Attributes (in progress)
