Examples for **Mono.Addins**

## About
This repo provides simple sequential sample projects for implementing [Mono.Addins](https://github.com/mono/mono-addins). Each project will implement a new feature/concept to assist you in learning and as a reference point.

Really enjoy using Mono.Addins, however there is a lack of consistent examples. Their text editor sample does dive in pretty good, so check it out if you're beyond the beginner steps.
